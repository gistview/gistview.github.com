# gistview #

This is a simple viewer for code examples hosted on GitHub Gist. Code up an
example using Gist, and then point people here to view the example and the
source code, live! The main source code for your example should be named
`index.html`. You can use relative links to other files in your Gist. You can
also use absolute links to shared files, such as CDN-hosted jQuery, Polymaps,
RaphaÃ«l, etc.
