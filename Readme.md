# GistView #

This is a simple viewer for code examples hosted on [GitHub] [Gist]. Code up an
example using Gist, and then point people here to view the example and the
source code, live! The main source code for your example should be named
`index.html`. You can use relative links to other files in your Gist. You can
also use absolute links to shared files, such as CDN-hosted jQuery, Polymaps,
RaphaÃ«l, etc.
